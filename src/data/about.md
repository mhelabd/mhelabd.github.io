# Intro
I am currently a Machine Learning Research Engineer at Google, where my work centers around the development of a foundational model for sensor data. This model holds significant promise, particularly in its application to wearable health and fitness technologies, among other impactful use cases. Before joining Google, I had the privilege of pursuing my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at Stanford University, where I focused on Computer Science and Mathematics, with a particular emphasis on Artificial Intelligence.
