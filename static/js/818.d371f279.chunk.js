This model holds significant promise, particularly in its application to wearable health and fitness technologies, among other impactful use cases. Before joining Google, I had the privilege of pursuing my Bachelor\'s and Master\'s degrees at Stanford University, where I focused on Computer Science and Mathematics, with a particular emphasis on Artificial Intelligence. \n\n# Passions\n- poverty allevation.\n- harnessing technology to uplift and enrich lives.\n- building aligned/ethical/moral Artificial Intelligence.\n- Using Artifical Intelligence to aid human descision making in their personal lives or in the public sphere.\n\n# Hobbies\n- Sports such as: Soccer, Skiing, Squash, Tennis, Badminton, etc.\n- [Non-Fiction Books](https://goodreads.com/michaelelabd) in Philosophy, Developmental Studies, Business, Economics, Political Science, History, etc.\n- Playing the guitar\n- Board games\n\n# Childhood\n- I was born and raised in Fayoum, Egypt. A beautiful small town an hour drive from Giza.\n- As a child, I was fascinated by sustainable cars. At 13, I showcased a "wind-powered" electric car prototype to Egyptian Government Officals and the Pope.\n- I enjoyed tinkering with technology and building gadgets to help people in their daily lives.\n- At 16, I immigrated alone to the United States in pursuit of a better education.\n\n# Qoutes!\n- "If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it." - Peter Singer\n- "Your brain is for having ideas, not storing them" - David Allen (maybe an excuse for my bad memory)\n'})]})})}}]);
